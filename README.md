## Assignment_pyspark

How to run:

move to the current directory, and then run below cmd in terminal
### spark-submit --jars mysql-connector-j-8.1.0.jar assignment_pyspark.py

Output:
After successful completion, there will be 9 directories(which contains 1 csv file) and 1 txt file under same directory where .py is present,
which holds the resultant df/result.

If you want to find my inference,
please check the code, where it gets commented.
